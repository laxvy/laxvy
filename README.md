## Hello.

A lot of my code is a work in progress (Thus private as a result), but I'm hoping for my github account to be representative of the things I love and everything about myself. I have a huge love for Low Level and Backend Programming, though I'm not averse to front end work either. 

On the Non-Coding side of things, I'm Currently Learning Japanese, albeit very slowly.
